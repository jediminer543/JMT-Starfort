This is a student project, aiming to create an open source game similar to dwarf fortress. It is written in java using LWJGL.

As yet incomplete.

##Plans
* Modularised (and modding capacity)
* Multi-threaded - Done
* 3D - Done, ish
* Multiple smaller worlds instead of a single larger one
* Expandable worlds
* Atmosphere (and depressurization)
* Spaceships
* People
* GUI
* Etc.
