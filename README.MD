[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/jediminer543/JMT-Starfort/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/jediminer543/JMT-Starfort?branch=master) - Since I'm also making an engine, and wish to test it


This is a student project, aiming to create an open source game similar to dwarf fortress, but in space, and with spaceships. And explosions. Don't forget the explosions...

It is written in java using LWJGL. As yet incomplete (probably indefinitely)

## Plans
* Modularised (and modding capacity) - In, mostly (no direct loading capacity, but modularised to n+1th degree)
* Multi-threaded - Done
* 3D world, segmented onto 2d planes - Done
* Depth, WITH THE POWER OF SHADER - Done
* Multiple smaller worlds instead of a single larger one - Done, ISH (no parent universe)
* Expandable worlds - Done
* Atmosphere (and depressurization)
* Spaceships - Multiple worlds do work. No parent universe for them to co-exist in yet though.
* People - In progress
* GUI - Vaugely; can create windows, with interactable buttons. No actual GUI though.
* Etc. - WIP
